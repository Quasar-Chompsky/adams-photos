    <h1>About Adam Rotert</h1>
    <p>Adam Rotert is an environmental scientist, GIS analyst, 
        musician and photographer based in 
        Washington, DC. When he's not goobing around learning how new 
        fascinating science-y things work, he's laying on the couch with his lil tea
        cup pooch Eevie, ethnically cleansing some aggressive aboriginal
        tribe in CIV 6 (while Eevie yawns and balefully licks her paws), 
        playing the bongo bongos (drums) in a sick Jazz ensemble with legions
        of adoring fans, or traveling the 
        world with his beautiful <strong>crime facilitating</strong>
        <em>(defense-attorney)</em> partner, Emma.</p>
    <h2>The Pizza Conundrum</h2>
    <p>Is it a coincidence that he loves pizza? That's a great question
        that is unfortunately outside the purview of this project, but is 
        nonetheless a question worth asking by any intrepid gumshoes.</p>
