website for Adam's photos
This is going to be a brutalist site for Adam's photographs--a place where he can store them and uplaod them. I want to use SVG files so that anyone using the website can see the folders in varying sizes. I would like to add CSS stylings to it so this project will actually continue as I learn more, as well as a js functionality. I will be solidifying many of the skills I've learned thus far on my coding journey, mostly how to use git and github and how to create a website, adding images and text to it. I want to add different buttons along the way that will jump to different sections. I would like this to be a really beautiful website, and I'm going to put in many hours perfecting it. Currently I don't have the skills to make this reality happen. RN i know enough about html to get the site up and moving, but I don't really have the CSS chops and certainly don't have the js chops to make the website interactive in such a way that you can select a photo and it will show in a transperent screen. But I will be there soon enough! By the end of this I'll have learned to an intermediate level HTML, and an intermediate level CSS and a beginner level JS. I will also have learned how to add text, stylize text, use tags, add images, and how to use relative links to navigate between pages in a website. I'll be much better at adding commit messages and developing the grit and gumption to continue on when I'm in over my head.
